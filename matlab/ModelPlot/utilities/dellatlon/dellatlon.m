% dellatlon - A mex tool to compute the arc-distance of two points
%             defined by lat/lon coordinate.
%             The computation core is a fortran code named delaz.f which
%             is a popular tool for computing the distance and azimuth
%             from a station to epicenter in seismology.
%
%  Usage: d = dellatlon(lat1,lon1,lat2,lon2)
