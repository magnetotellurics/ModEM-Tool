Making 3D plots:

First, CascadiaPlot.m is run to read in the output file
from WSINV3D and make some data structures that will
be used by the other interpolation and plotting programs.
The basic structure, named "Res" is save to the saveFile
declared in the second line of CascadiaPlot.m.

There is some interpolation and padding done (which
might not be necessary, but this is what I did to start with,
and now thats the way it is.  Those who don't like it can
start over if they wish!)  The net result is resistivity
defined on the NODES of the computational grid (not the cells).
The script also converts x,y coordinates to latitudes
and longitudes.  This is done by reading cas_resp.01
to get x,y (numerical grid) coordinates of the cascadia MT
sites.  Then "sitelocations" is loaded to get lat,lon coordinates
of the site, and the centroid lat/lon is assigned to the
x/y location of the centroid.  This determines a mapping
from x/y to lat/lon.  Note that all of this (file names)
is hard coded for the Cascadia array.

The latitudes, longitude, and depths of all nodes are given
in arrays Res.Y, Res.X, and Res.Z respectively. 
Res.log10_rho contains log_10 of resistivity.  Some other
arrays of coordinates are included, but aren't really needed.

CascadiaPlot.m needs to be run once to make the data structures
(for each new inverse file you want to plot; note also that
this 

The three basic plotting routines are LatSections, DepthSections,
and DiagSections.  These make a set of E-W sections at constant
latitude, a set of plan-view sections at constant depth,
and a set of diagonal sections.

To use LatSections.m you need to specify (by editing lines near
begining of file):
%    list of latitudes sections to plot
    sectionLats = [45.5 46 46.5 47 47.5];
%  resistivity limits
    rhoLims = [0.5,3.5];
%  latitude, longitude, depth limits (deg/deg/km)
    latLims = [45,48];
    lonLims = [236.5,239];
    zLims = [0,100];

To use DepthSections.m you need to specify (by editing lines near
begining of file):
%    list of depth sections to plot
   Depths = [30  65 100 135  ];
%  resistivity limits
   rhoLims = [.5,3.5];
%  latitude, longitude, depth limits (deg/deg/km)
   rhoLims = [.5,3.5];
   latLims = [42,49];
   lonLims = [236,244];
   zLims = [0,150];

To use DiagSections.m you need to specify (by editing lines near
begining of file):
%    list of lat/lon endpoints
   ll1 = [48,236; 46.6, 236; 49 236.6];
   ll2 = [42,242; 42, 240; 43.4 242];
% latitude, longitude, depth limits   
   LatLims = [42,50];
   lonLims = [235,244];
   zLims = [00,150];
%  resistivity limit
   rhoLims = [.5,3.5];

At the ends of these scripts some additional scripts may be called:

--> plotMap : adds a map on the surface
--> plotSlab : plots slab in 3d
--> addVolcs : adds symbols for Mt. Rainier, Mt. St. Helens, Mt Adams
(3 main stratovolcanos in Washington state ... used for localized
plot of sections near SWCC).
All of these are added/deleted depending on what
you want in the plot.  All of these are hard coded for Cascadia.


Note that additional matlab m-files are called by the files listed 
above, and there are some data files (contents of SLAB, map, 
idaho.bln ... maybe still something I'v forgotten).  
You need everything in this directory to be sure
that the plotting codes work.

Finally, these scripts make 3D plots, which initially
are viewed "from above".  You need to rotate to make a useful
view.
